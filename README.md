# Learning Math in Python + My First Calculator

Today, I learned how to do **math with Python**. Just like using a calculator â€” but this time, I built my own using code!

## What I Learned

- How to add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers in Python.
- How to use **variables** to store numbers.
- How to use the **input()** function to ask the user for information.
- I also learned how to turn what someone types into a number using `int()` and `float()`.

## What I Practiced

### Practice 1: Simple Math
- Added 2 numbers
- Multiplied 3 numbers
- Found the remainder (using `%`)
- Used powers (like `2 ** 3` = 8)

### Practice 2: Ask the User
- Asked the user for their age
- Calculated how old theyâ€™ll be in 5 years

### Practice 3: My First Calculator! ðŸ§®
- I asked the user for 2 numbers
- Then I added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided them
- It showed the answers like a real calculator!

### Bonus: Percentage Tool
- I asked for a number and a percent
- Then showed what that percent of the number is
- Example: 25% of 100 is 25
